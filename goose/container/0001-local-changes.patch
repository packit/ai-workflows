Subject: [PATCH] Placeholder for custom Goose changes

This is a placeholder patch used to prevent build errors if no custom
patches are placed in goose/container/.

It can be overwritten locally to make changes to the goose source tree
when running `make debug-build`, or additional patches can be placed in
goose/container/ using the .patch extension. They will be applied
automatically by `git am`.

To create a patch from a goose checkout, run:

    git format-patch -1 -o /path/to/ai-workflows/goose/container

This file does not change any code and is safe to leave in place.
